Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate student from [School of EECS, Peking University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/).

Currently, I'm privileged to be supervised by Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). I have also been working as an research intern at the [Visual Computing and Learning Lab (VCL)](https://vcl.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Wenzheng Chen](https://wenzhengchen.github.io/) and Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/).

In general, my interests lie in 3D computer vision and graphics. More specifically, I'm passionate about the high-quality reconstruction, photorealistic simulation and neural representation, enabling people to better perceive and interact with the world.
